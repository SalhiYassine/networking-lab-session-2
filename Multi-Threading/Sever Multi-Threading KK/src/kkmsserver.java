  The new connections are made by launching a new
  execution thread kkmsthread.  The argument
  serverSocket.accept means that the thread will
  connect to whichever client demanded the connection
  The start command just tells the kkmsthread object
  to begin execution.

  Every thread object has a run() method instead of a
  main() method.  Start() just tells the object to use
  the run() method to begin execution.  These threads
  will be timesliced by the operating system
